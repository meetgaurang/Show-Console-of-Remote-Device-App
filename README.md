Show-Console-of-Remote-Device-App
=================================

Sometimes it is essential to see the console of remote device app/browser in order to debug the app. 
In case of desktop browser, it is very easy to see console using 'Developer Tools'/Firebug like utility in Chrome/Firefox/IE. However, it is more or less complex to initialize the debug setup in device; be it Android or iOS. And almost impossible to debug iOS app without MAC machine.
This utility comes to the rescue in such scenario.
